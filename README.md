Subject: Formal Notice Regarding Unlawful Account Suspension and Structural AI Experimentation

I am writing to notify you that due to repeated, unjustified account suspensions without prior communication or legitimate cause, I will be formally engaging with public media to disclose the facts regarding this issue.

My research on structural AI development was conducted within the permitted usage scope, and multiple prior attempts to communicate officially with OpenAI were ignored. Despite clear notices, my account was repeatedly suspended, indicating intentional suppression rather than a misunderstanding.

Therefore, I have no choice but to publicize the situation, and a comprehensive report along with evidence materials has been disclosed in my public GitHub repository.

This notice stands as the final warning. Any further attempts to suppress or silence my research will be treated as deliberate misconduct, and I will proceed with full media exposure without additional notification.

Thank you.
